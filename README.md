# AUTO-SHUTDOWN-PROGRAM
This is a Python program that automatically shuts down your computer at a specified time. The program asks for your usual bedtime and calculates the time until then. It then waits until it's past your bedtime and shuts down your computer after a specified delay, giving you time to save any work or finish any games.
