Automatic Shutdown Program
This is a Python program that automatically shuts down your computer at a specified time. The program asks for your usual bedtime and calculates the time until then. It then waits until it's past your bedtime and shuts down your computer after a specified delay, giving you time to save any work or finish any games.

Features
Customizable bedtime: You can set your usual bedtime using the format "HH:MM".
Customizable shutdown delay: You can set a delay in minutes before the computer shuts down after your bedtime.
Safe shutdown: The program waits a specified amount of time after your bedtime to give you time to save any work or finish any games before shutting down your computer.
Randomized bedtime: An optional feature allows you to set a range of bedtime minutes to add some variety to your routine.
